# 0.16.0 2021-10-12
- Support for branch autocomplete functionality on gt branch-related commands. Enable this functionality by running `gt completion` and adding the ouputted bash script to your relevant bash profile (e.g. ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc).
- Added functionality to query users for feedback on the Graphite CLI.
- Refactor the suite of gt submit commands to make them more easily cancellable; re-ordered submit to edit all PRs locally before doing any writes and cancelling mid-submit will save any previously entered data (e.g. title and body).
- Submit also now includes a `--dry-run` flag to show the user what will be submitted in the invocation.
- Submit queries GitHub for PRs before submitting, resolving an issue where submit would sometimes try to create a new PR though one already existed for that head branch/base branch combo on GitHub (Graphite just didn't know about it).

# 0.14.2 2021-09-29
